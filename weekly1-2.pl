# Write a one-liner to solve the FizzBuzz problem and print the numbers 1 through 20. However, any number divisible by 3 should be replaced by the word ‘fizz’ and any divisible by 5 by the word ‘buzz’. Those numbers that are both divisible by 3 and 5 become ‘fizzbuzz’.

perl -E '@aa = map { ( $_ % 3 ) == 0 ? "fizz" :  ( $_ % 5 ) == 0    ? "buzz"  : $_   } 1..20; print @aa;'
